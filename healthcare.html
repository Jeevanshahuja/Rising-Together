    <h2>Healthcare & Medical Facilities in Salampur Gujjar</h2>
    <p>Access to quality healthcare is one of the biggest challenges in Salampur Gujjar. Many people face long travel distances to reach the nearest healthcare facility, and essential services are often limited. We aim to highlight the importance of accessible and affordable healthcare for all.</p>

    <h3>Current Healthcare Services</h3>
    <p>The village has a small primary healthcare center that provides basic medical services. However, it lacks necessary resources like trained staff, medications, and proper sanitation. Hereâ€™s a list of services available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Check-ups</li>
        <li>Vaccinations for children</li>
        <li>Emergency care and first aid</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Improving Healthcare Access</h3>
    <p>To improve healthcare access, we must advocate for better infrastructure, funding, and training for healthcare workers. Additionally, raising awareness about health issues such as maternal and child health is crucial.</p>
